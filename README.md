# Juglandaceae
Blast/: The scripts were used to get BLASTP hits and reciprocal best hits (RBHs).
Gene-content/: The scripts were used to get cluster information of each orthogroups.
KaKs_calculator/: The scripts were used to compute Ka, Ks, Ka/Ks for collinear gene pairs, and got the median Ks value for each collinear block.
KEGG-DNA-repair/: The scripts were used to get KEGG Orthology (KO) annotation.
Share-WGD/: The scripts were used to detect homologous quartets, constructed gene trees and counted the number of each topology.
Plot_script/: The R scripts were used to plot the distribution of Ks value.
